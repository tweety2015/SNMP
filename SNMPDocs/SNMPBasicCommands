Q. What is SNMP?
Ans: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application–layer protocol.
It is a part of Transmission Control Protocol⁄Internet Protocol (TCP⁄IP) protocol suite.
SNMP is one of the widely accepted protocols to manage and monitor network elements. 

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management. 
It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as 
servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Developed in 1988 to provide network-device-monitoring capability for TCP/IP-based networks, 
SNMP was approved as an Internet standard in 1990 by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) 
and has been in wide use since that time

SNMP related RFC: 1157, 1420

Q. What is MIB?
Ans: A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities in 
a communication network. Most often associated with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
the term is also used more generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model.
A management information base (MIB) is a formal description of a set of network objects that can 
be managed using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The format of the MIB is 
defined as part of the SNMP. (All other MIBs are extensions of this basic management information base.) 
MIB-I refers to the initial MIB definition; MIB-II refers to the current definition. SNMPv2 includes 
MIB-II and adds some new objects.
There are MIBs (or more accurately, MIB extensions) for each set of related network entities that 
can be managed.

Q. What is SMI?
Ans:RFC 2578, “Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).” A standard that describes the 
object syntax for specifying how MIB data is referenced and stored

Q. What is SNMP basic components and their functionalities?
https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/what-is-snmp.html
Ans: SNMP consists of
1. SNMP Manager
2. Managed devices
3. SNMP agent
4. Management Information Database Otherwise called as Management Information Base (MIB)

1. SNMP Manager: A manager or management system is a separate entity that is responsible to 
communicate with the SNMP agent implemented network devices. This is typically a computer 
that is used to run one or more network management systems.
    1. SNMP Manager’s key functions
    2. Queries agents
    3. Gets responses from agents
    4. Sets variables in agents
    5. Acknowledges asynchronous events from agents

2. Managed Devices: A managed device or the network element is a part of the network that 
requires some form of monitoring and management e.g. routers, switches, servers, workstations, 
printers, UPSs, etc...

3. SNMP Agent: The agent is a program that is packaged within the network element. Enabling 
the agent allows it to collect the management information database from the device locally 
and makes it available to the SNMP manager, when it is queried for. These agents could be 
standard (e.g. Net-SNMP) or specific to a vendor (e.g. HP insight agent)

SNMP agent’s key functions
    1. Collects management information about its local environment
    2. Stores and retrieves management information as defined in the MIB.
    3. Signals an event to the manager.
    4. Acts as a proxy for some non–SNMP manageable network node.

4. Management Information Database Otherwise called as Management Information Base (MIB):
Management Information Base (MIB) is a collection of Information for managing network element. 
The MIBs comprises of managed objects identified by the name Object Identifier (Object ID or OID).
Each Identifier is unique and denotes specific characteristics of a managed device. When queried for, 
the return value of each identifier could be different e.g. Text, Number, Counter, etc...

There are two types of Managed Object or Object ID: Scalar and Tabular. 
They could be better understandable with an example
    Scalar: Device’s vendor name, the result can be only one. (As definition says: "Scalar Object 
    define a single object instance")

    Tabular: CPU utilization of a Quad Processor, this would give me a result for each CPU 
    separately, means there will be 4 results for that particular Object ID. (As definition says: 
    "Tabular object defines multiple related object instance that are grouped together in MIB tables")

Every Object ID is organized hierarchically in MIB. The MIB hierarchy can be represented in a tree 
structure with individual variable identifier.
A typical object ID will be a dotted list of integers. For example, the OID in RFC1213 for 
"sysDescr" is .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1

===============================================================================================
Q. What are SNMP basic commands?
Ans: 
1. snmpget Command: 
===================
The GET operation is a request sent by the manager to the managed device. It is performed to 
retrieve one or more values from the managed device.

Example:
=========
snmpget -mALL -v1 -cpublic snmp_agent_Ip_address sysName.0
As stated in the description of the sysName.0 MIB object in the SNMPv2-MIB, this command returns an 
administratively assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node’s 
fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value returned is the zero-length string.

For example:

% snmpget -v2c -cprivate -mALL snmp_agent_Ip_address sysName.0 sysObjectID.0 ilomCtrlDateAndTime.0
SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: SUNSPHOSTNAME
SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: SUN-ILOM-SMI-MIB::sunILOMSystems
SUN-ILOM-CONTROL-MIB::ilomCtrlDateAndTime.0 = STRING: 2007-12-10,20:33:32.0

In addition to the sysName.0 object, this command displays the content of the sysObjectID.0 and the 
ilomCtrlDateAndTime.0 MIB objects. Notice that the MIB file name is given for each MIB object as part 
of the reply.

The following descriptions of the MIB objects are taken from the MIB files.
sysName - An administratively assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node’s 
fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
sysObjectID - The vendor’s authoritative identification of the network management subsystem 
contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises sub-tree (1.3.6.1.4.1) 
and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining ‘what kind of box’ is being managed.
ilomCtrlDataAndTime - The date and time of the device.


2. SNMPGetNext:This operation is similar to the GET. The significant difference is that the 
GET NEXT operation retrieves the value of the next OID in the MIB tree. Instead of returing the data you 
requested, it returns the next OID in the tree and its value:

Example:

% snmpgetnext -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysUpTime.0
system.sysContact.0 = Wes Hardaker wjhardaker@ucdavis.edu

You could use the snmpgetnext command to manually walk down the mib tree in the remote host, 
by always specifying the last OID that you saw on the command line for the next command:

% snmpgetnext -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysUpTime.0
system.sysContact.0 = Wes Hardaker wjhardaker@ucdavis.edu
% snmpgetnext -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysContact.0
system.sysName.0 = net-snmp
% snmpgetnext -v 2c -c demopublic test.net-snmp.org system.sysName.0
system.sysLocation.0 = UCDavis


3. GetBulk:  The GETBULK operation is used to retrieve voluminous data from large MIB table.

Example:
