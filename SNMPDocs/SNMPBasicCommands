Q. What is SNMP?
Ans: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application–layer protocol.
It is a part of Transmission Control Protocol⁄Internet Protocol (TCP⁄IP) protocol suite.
SNMP is one of the widely accepted protocols to manage and monitor network elements. 

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management. 
It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as 
servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Developed in 1988 to provide network-device-monitoring capability for TCP/IP-based networks, 
SNMP was approved as an Internet standard in 1990 by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) 
and has been in wide use since that time

SNMP related RFC: 1157, 1420

Q. What is MIB?
Ans: A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities in 
a communication network. Most often associated with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), 
the term is also used more generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model.
A management information base (MIB) is a formal description of a set of network objects that can 
be managed using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The format of the MIB is 
defined as part of the SNMP. (All other MIBs are extensions of this basic management information base.) 
MIB-I refers to the initial MIB definition; MIB-II refers to the current definition. SNMPv2 includes 
MIB-II and adds some new objects.
There are MIBs (or more accurately, MIB extensions) for each set of related network entities that 
can be managed.

Q. What is SMI?
Ans:RFC 2578, “Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).” A standard that describes the 
object syntax for specifying how MIB data is referenced and stored
